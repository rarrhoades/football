1.0
(/opt/football/Releases/1.0/)
Initial Development. Will contain 2 ESPN leagues, and only track NFL players that have ever been on the roster of a user. Weekly data will be imported by the site admin, and entered manually through an admin page. Information on scoring will not be stored in the db - just the points earned.

2.0
(/opt/football/Releases/2.0/)
Mobile Development. Create an iPhone app

3.0
(/opt/football/Releases/3.0/)
Contain multiple types of leagues (ESPN, Yahoo, NFL Network, etc.) that will track all players over multiple years (how far back to be decided later). Stats will be fetched automatically from the site - and scoring will be stored locally to determine points.
